# Blockchain

**Basic local blockchain**
n\
This project is aimed at securely saving transaction information. This Blockchain is local therefore there is no general consensus distributed among many machines. The Proof of Work is implemented in this model however, since this is not a distributed blockchain, it is not needed to add blocks to the chain. Yet, the PoW is based on a sha256 hash search with a default difficulty of a has beginning with two 0's.
